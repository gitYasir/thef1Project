# About the project

This is a project I work on in my spare time, to practice using the the tools I've learned through the School of Code bootcamp and personal research.

# Technologies used

## Currently

    `create-react-app`
      I'm using create-react-app along with react router to set up the pages and display different data sets.

## Future

    After setting up the skeleton of my project, I plan to add testing using jest to insure I don't break what I've already made and to also practice TDD for the future features.

    I also plan to practice using a tool I've done research on in my own time, Chart.JS, to visually display driver race records.
